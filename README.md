# Welding-size
### Prediction of weld sizes in electron beam welding of thin-walled structures for aerospace purposes

> [!NOTE]
> The task was to solve the regression problem for predicting the depth and width of the welded joint by completing the necessary steps (exploratory analysis, preprocessing)
